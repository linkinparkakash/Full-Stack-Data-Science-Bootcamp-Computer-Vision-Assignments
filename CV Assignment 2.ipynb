    "# 1. Explain convolutional neural network, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ans:\n",
    "# A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model specifically designed for processing structured grid-like data, \n",
    "# such as images. It consists of multiple layers of specialized filters called convolutional layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In a CNN, the input data is passed through these convolutional layers, where each layer applies a set of learnable filters to the input.\n",
    "# These filters detect various patterns or features in the data, such as edges, textures, or shapes. The convolutional layers also \n",
    "# utilize other operations like pooling and activation functions to extract and enhance important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The output of the last convolutional layer is flattened and passed through one or more fully connected layers, which perform high-level\n",
    "# feature aggregation and classification. The final layer typically uses a softmax activation function to produce the probability\n",
    "# distribution over the target classes.\n",
